# Welcome to the Clarity project!

## About the project
Clarity is a client-side JavaScript library that:
* Observes page layout and user's interactions with the page
* Inspects network requests on the page
* Logs obtained information by sending JSON objects to a specified endpoint

## Goals
* Enable a generic solution that is able to capture telemetry from third-party web-sites
* Encourage participation from open-source community
* Minimal configuration required by third party web-sites to get started
* Mobile first

## Non-Goals
* Make Clarity web-site specific

## Privacy Notice
Clarity handles sensitive data with care. By default content on the page is masked before upload, so no actual text from the page is sent to the server.
All data collection is performed solely with the purpose of providing better insights into customers' pages interactions and improving their users' experiences.

## Current State
Clarity is a project in active development. While it's not yet ready for production use, we continue making improvements and encourage the community to join us in the process!
